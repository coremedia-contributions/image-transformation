_CoreMedia Content Cloud_ can benefit from an image transformation based on a shared service that supports
the WebP and Avif format out-of-the-box. Due to the nature of shared services, it works differently than the built-in
image transformation library used in earlier versions and in self-managed installations of the CoreMedia Content Cloud.

Learn more about the specifics of and how to get access to the image transformation at
[Introduction To The Image Transformation](https://documentation.coremedia.com/services/image-transformation/image-transformation-cloud/).

In this repository, the public releases of the required plugins and the blobs migration tool are available. The naming convention
used here is:

* Releases of the IMTS Plugin are prefixed with _imts-plugin_.

Please take care to use the latest matching versions of the respective plugins as indicated in the releases. Otherwise, your 
_CoreMedia Content Cloud_ components may fail to start or produce errors during operation.
