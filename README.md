_CoreMedia Content Cloud_ can benefit from an image transformation based on a shared service that supports
the WebP and Avif format out-of-the-box. Due to the nature of shared services, it works differently than the built-in
image transformation library used in earlier versions and in self-managed installations of the CoreMedia Content Cloud.
